### 1. GIT

In my repository, I have made numerous commits, that helped me understand as well practice the following git concepts:-

- commit
- push
- pull
- force push
- commit amend
- pull requests
- merge
- set-origin
- add-origin
- undo
- revert

Some of the git concepts can be well-viewed in the commit history as well as closed pull requests in this repository
